## About this project 

As a full-stack developer in progress, I've documented my learning journey in this repository. Tracking my evolution has been invaluable. I've honed my skills in Javascript and OOP and can objectively measure my growth over time.

As I continue to expand my knowledge, I'll also be documenting my exploration of new programming languages and technologies within this repository.

If you're interested in my work and believe my skill set aligns with your project needs, please don't hesitate to reach out!
